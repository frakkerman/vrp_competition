# Vehicle Routing Competition

Welcome to the Vehicle Routing Competition!

In this competition, you can earn bonus points by designing well-performing algorithms for the vehicle routing problem.

## Competition rules and guidelines

1. We trust you to do your best to learn how to design well-performing algorithms by yourself, without cheating. Note that we will check the code of the winning group and some randomly selected groups.
2. You can only use the Python libraries listed in `main.py`, consult with us if you like to use other libraries.
3. The competition consist of X rounds, with in each round a winning team.
4. Scores are determined based on the solutions with the highest profit and computational times.
5. We limit the computational time to X minutes per day per group. If you did not find a solution within X minutes, your submission is invalid.
6. Only your best scoring solution is shown on the leaderboard. 
7. After submitting, it might take some time before your score appears on the leaderboard, depending on the length of the queue of submissions.
8. Code runs on a virtual machine with an XYZ CPU at XGHz and YGB RAM.
9. No rights can be derived from this information and the leaderboard at any moment in time.
